Blog

A blog that tracks workouts and progress. 

Its workout log lets you view daily workouts quickly. Add an exercise to the workout log and start recording sets of weight and reps or possibly distance and time.
Keeping track of your workouts and gains in the gym is critical to improving strength and overall health. So having a virtual journal that tracks your progress is valuable. This exercise plog allows you to log exercises, the weight you used, reps, sets, and more. Along with having pictures that show the exercises.
