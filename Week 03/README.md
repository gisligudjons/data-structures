Hey yall.

This weeks assignment was to basically write a script that makes a request to the
Texas A&M Geoservices Geocoding APIs for each address, using the address data from Weekly Assignment 2.

Steps:
No heavy modifications were made to fix the code, a little bit to remove uneccessary lines 

1. Create an account on the Texas A&M geoservices website and get an API key
2. The data was already parsed efficiently so no real modifications needed.
3. create various variables that contain information about: the lovation of the meetings and where I want to save the json.parse
4. Create a function that adds the assignment requested json querys by using eachSeries in the async module to iterate over an array and operate on each item in the array
5. Make an API request for those querys and write them to a file in the Week03 folder.

Thank you guys
