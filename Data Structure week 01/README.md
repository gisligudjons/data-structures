Hi there! 

This project was fairly challenging for me. I'm new to Javascript and I really wanted the code to loop.
Couldn't get it to do what I wanted, which I suspect will be a regular occurrence
The challenge was mainly in the fact that I wasn't able to make a new txt file for every website. 
So the code would run 10 times but make a new txt file every time, so I would end up with tenth file only.

Repeating the code ten times was of course quite simple and I was able to understand what I was doing. The videos were really helpful for thast aspect!
